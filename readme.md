Represent Complexity:
Asympotic notations - mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity :
BOT : 1. Big - O notation (o Notation) - worst case complexity 2. Omega Notation - best case complexity 3. Theta Notation - Average case complexity

Algorithm analisis:

- running time dari algorithm tidka bisa diprediksi,
- evaluate perfomance of an algorightm in terms of its input size
  a. time complexity: Amount of time taken by an algorightm, as a function of input size
  b. Space complexity: Amount of memory taken by an algorightm, as a function of input size
